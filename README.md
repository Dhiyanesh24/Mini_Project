# Super-Resolution using ESRGAN

## Discreption
This project is about implementing a super-resolution approach using the Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN). It takes low-resolution images as input and generates high-resolution images, improving image clarity and detail. The project involves preprocessing input data, training the ESRGAN model on high-resolution data, evaluating the model's performance, and finally using the trained model to produce high-resolution outputs. It can be applied in fields like medical imaging, satellite imagery, and any area where image quality enhancement is needed.
